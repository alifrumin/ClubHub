- The `planning` folder contains:
  - [x] a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - [x] a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - [x] a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

- [x] The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or email address through which the creator can be contacted
- [x] The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes
- The video contains:

## Code Quality
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- [x] The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming
- [x] The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code
- [x] For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors
**Meets Expectations**

## Deployment and Functionality
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- [x] Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it
- [x] The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)
- [x] The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository
- [ ] The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

## Overall
**Meets Expectations** Great work, Alice! Your app is full-featured and user-friendly. Though your comments on the project submission form suggest that editing/adding memberships on the clubs edit page was a bit of a headache, the fact that you were able to accomplish it shows a sophisticated understanding of your data model -- well done!

One bug that I encountered as a user -- the date doesn't seem to be rendering properly on the meeting show page or the club index page. Adding a formatting/parsing method to the meeting model might help iron this out.

The next steps list in your readme is great! Your use of join tables is solid here, so I'd particularly encourage you to implement the themes model you had mentioned. It seems like you're really getting into the nitty gritty of customizing forms, both in the work you've done and the work you're hoping to do -- they can be a pain sometimes, but they're central to happy users and happy databases, so that's something that should be exciting to potential employers...
